# One-time Pad Creator

My attempt at replicating the one true non-crackable crytography method. Although the key-generation is not true random as well as possibly allowing for keys to be re-used, this quick little python script is all you need to create and decode your own one time pad messages! 

Just clone this repository and run gui_Onetimepad.pyw and a small, light-weight GUI will pop up and help you along the way. Have fun using the best way to encrypt your messages.
